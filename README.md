# Solana Algorithmic Trading Bot üöÄ

An advanced algorithmic trading bot for Solana, implementing a **Mean Reversion Strategy** for SOL trading. Built with TypeScript, this bot provides real-time market analysis, automated trade execution, risk management, and a beautiful monitoring dashboard.

## üìä Strategy Overview

The bot implements a **Mean Reversion Strategy** based on the principle that prices tend to revert to their mean over time. When SOL price deviates significantly from its moving average, the bot identifies trading opportunities:

- **BUY Signal**: When price falls below the mean by a significant margin (oversold)
- **SELL Signal**: When price rises above the mean by a significant margin (overbought)

### Key Indicators Used:
- Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- Bollinger Bands
- Standard Deviation & Z-Score
- RSI (Relative Strength Index) for confirmation
- Volume filters to avoid low-liquidity periods

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-Source Price Data**: Aggregates prices from Pyth Network, BirdEye, CoinGecko, and Binance
- **Jupiter Integration**: Executes trades through Jupiter aggregator for best prices
- **Risk Management**: Advanced position sizing, stop-loss, take-profit, and drawdown protection
- **Paper Trading Mode**: Test strategies without real funds
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Beautiful web interface for monitoring performance
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for trades, signals, and system events
- **Backtesting**: Test strategies on historical data (coming soon)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Blockchain**: Solana Web3.js, SPL Token
- **DEX Integration**: Jupiter Aggregator API
- **Price Feeds**: Pyth Network, BirdEye API, CoinGecko
- **Real-time Data**: WebSocket connections
- **Monitoring**: Express.js + Socket.IO dashboard
- **Technical Analysis**: TechnicalIndicators library

## üìã Prerequisites

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your settings:

```env
# CRITICAL: Add your wallet private key (base58 encoded)
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Start with paper trading for safety
PAPER_TRADING=true
TRADING_ENABLED=true

# Strategy parameters
MA_PERIOD=20
STD_DEV_MULTIPLIER=2
TIMEFRAME=15m
MAX_POSITION_SIZE=100
RISK_PER_TRADE=0.02
```

### 3. Run the Bot

**Development mode (with auto-reload):**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

**Production mode:**
```bash
pnpm build

```

### 4. Access Dashboard

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `TRADING_ENABLED` | Enable/disable trading | `false` |
| `PAPER_TRADING` | Use simulated trading | `true` |
| `MA_PERIOD` | Moving average period | `20` |
| `STD_DEV_MULTIPLIER` | Bollinger Band width | `2` |
| `MAX_POSITION_SIZE` | Max position in USD | `1000` |
| `RISK_PER_TRADE` | Risk per trade (%) | `0.02` |
| `TIMEFRAME` | Analysis timeframe | `15m` |

### Risk Management Settings

- **Daily Loss Limit**: 10% of max position size
- **Max Drawdown**: 20% from peak
- **Stop Loss**: 5% per position
- **Take Profit**: 10% per position

## üìä Trading Logic

### Entry Conditions

The bot enters a position when:

1. **Oversold (BUY)**:
   - Price is 2+ standard deviations below SMA
   - RSI < 30 (if available)
   - Volume meets minimum threshold
   - Risk checks pass

2. **Overbought (SELL)**:
   - Price is 2+ standard deviations above SMA
   - RSI > 70 (if available)
   - Volume meets minimum threshold
   - Open long position exists

### Exit Conditions

Positions are closed when:
- Price returns to mean (Z-score < 0.1)
- Stop loss triggered (-5%)
- Take profit reached (+10%)
- Position age exceeds 24 hours
- Emergency stop at -10% loss

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Never commit your `.env` file** - It contains sensitive keys
2. **Start with paper trading** to understand the bot's behavior
3. **Use small position sizes** when starting live trading
4. **Monitor the bot regularly** - Automated trading carries risks
5. **Keep your private keys secure** - Consider using a dedicated trading wallet
6. **Set conservative risk parameters** initially

## üìà Performance Monitoring

The dashboard provides real-time metrics:

- Current SOL price and 24h change
- Open positions with P&L
- Recent trades and signals
- Win rate and total P&L
- Risk metrics (drawdown, daily loss)
- Price chart with entry/exit points

## üß™ Testing Strategies

### Paper Trading

Always test new strategies in paper trading mode first:

```bash
PAPER_TRADING=true
TRADING_ENABLED=true
pnpm dev
```

### Backtesting (Coming Soon)

Run historical simulations:

```bash
pnpm backtest
```

## üìù Logs

The bot maintains detailed logs in the `logs/` directory:

- `combined.log` - All events
- `error.log` - Errors only
- `trades.log` - Trade execution details

### Adding New Strategies

1. Create a new strategy file in `src/strategies/`
2. Implement the strategy interface
3. Update the main bot to use your strategy
4. Test thoroughly in paper trading mode

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Insufficient SOL balance"**
   - Ensure your wallet has enough SOL for trades and fees
   - Check you're on the correct network (mainnet/devnet)

2. **"Failed to get price from any source"**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify RPC endpoint is responsive
   - Some price sources may require API keys

3. **"Transaction simulation failed"**
   - Slippage may be too low
   - Insufficient SOL for fees
   - DEX liquidity issues
